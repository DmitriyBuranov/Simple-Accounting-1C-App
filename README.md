# Personal Accounting (1C MobileApp for Android)

This is a simple application for personal accounting based on the [1C Platform](https://1c-dn.com/1c_enterprise/what_is_1c_enterprise/).
This is one of the simplest ways to understand the main idea of the 1C platform and the types of tasks that it can help resolve. This app does not need a license and installed platform as desktops versions.

To build this application, you need a special [1C configuration -a mobile application builder](https://1c-dn.com/library/tutorials/mobile_application_installing_and_setting_up_mobile_application_builder/).
You can download the builded android app from my [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fvXWjXIfEXLuwzDX95dN1gmKZIVtT5uc/view?usp=sharing).

In the application you can calculate your expenses. For better useability implemented barcode accounting  and remembering the last price of products.
